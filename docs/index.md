# PyVolt

Welcome to PyVolt! PyVolt is a simple and flexible wrapper for [Revolt.chat](https://revolt.chat) built to be fast and reliable.

## Key features

- Built on [Python](https://python.org)'s `asyncio` library.
- Sane rate limit handling built to prevent 429s.
- Efficient memory usage.
- A customizable architecture built to be rewritten.
- Focus on supporting both **bots** and **users** accounts.

!!! note

    Currently PyVolt only supports installing via Git, in the future we plan to add [PyPI](https://pypi.org) as a distributor.
